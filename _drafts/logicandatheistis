Many people who identify as Atheist, pride themselves as being very rational and scientific and strong minded. And if I wanted to guess I would guess on average they are better decision makers and more logical compared to the average person.<br />
But like any other group of people, it is not uncommon to find bias and prejudice and self centered arrogance among them. <br />
This is not something to be surprised by, any human can have these but it is more unsettling when seen from people who you expect more of them.
