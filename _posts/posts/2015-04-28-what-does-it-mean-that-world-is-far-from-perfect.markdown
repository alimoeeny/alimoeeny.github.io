Most of grow up with the idea that a god or some overwhelmingly powerful and knowledgable (and often kind and benificent) entity created the world for us and planned our lives.
This has a weird implication.
Often times, in life, we need to learn from our past and plan for future.
If we think some reasonable, wise and knowledgeable entity planned the events in our lives and there are rewards and repercussions for our actions we make different conclusions compare to a situation when we think the universe does not care specifically about us and we need to find the rules of the real life and plan as we go.
It makes a lot of difference if you know that life is not meritocratic. It explains a lot of the differences between people and the lives they lead.
Maybe even more importantly, when you plan based on your assumptions and your plans fail, you have two options ahead of you. You may conclude that your plan or the execution of your plan was flawed (you are incompetent, or weak or now good enough) or you may question the assumptions you based your plan on (it is not a meritocratic world, people are not looking to find the truth, good people and good actions are not necessarily rewarded, if you create a lot of value for others you won't necessarily benefit some yourself ...).
