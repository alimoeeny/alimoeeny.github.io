If someone had told me that life will speed up as you grow up, I don't think I would have believed them when I was a kid.
But now I know it does!
There are books on this, but I have not read them. Maybe because I fear I don't like what I'd see.
There is even an entry in the "dictionary of obscure sorrows" titled, `Zenosyne: The Sense That Time Keeps Going Faster`

If I am to speculate, I'd say it is because of the vibrancy of senses in childhood.
It is because we are learning so much in childhood.
When we are learning time slows down. At least it does for me.
As we grow up, we shut down our learning channels. A large number of people almost stop learning altogether, they even resist learning new things.
I think the more we keep ourselves in the learning mode, the more our lives slow down, the more we enjoy life.
