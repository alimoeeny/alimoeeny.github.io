In many cases, the way we teach kids the lessons of life, is by shaming them, and scaring them and generally \"training\" them to avoid what they enjoy and do what is \"right\". Which makes a lot of sense, since we want them to learn to control their basic instincts, or their \"animal\" instincts. Regardless of what you think of this, you cannot deny that this leave a gap. We never teach the kids how to enjoy the enjoyable things that they do. The joys of life are always associated with guilt. Like when you play a game, instead of enjoying it, you carry the guilt with you. And this can lead to a general in ability to enjoy things.

One unfortunate side effect of this is, inability to enjoy hard earned triumphs of life. So you controlled your desires and worked hard and achieved what you planned to achieve. Now you should enjoy it. If you cannot enjoy it, you will have a miserable life and you will not reinforce what helped you to succeed with the positivity of success.
