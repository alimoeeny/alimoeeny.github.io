Have you ever had the experience that you saw something on TV or read about it and decided you want to do it yourself. Like you read about a hero of some kind and told yourself, I want to be like that. I want to be a scientist, or an entrepreneur or a fighter pilot or a doctor ....

Then you spend some time and effort to go about it and along the way you figured out that you really don't like the reality of that thing, you liked the depiction of it, or you like what it looked and felt in your head but not what it feels or how it is done in reality. In most cases what you read (specially what you watch) gives you the wrong impression about what it's like to be in the shoes of the heroes or celebrities.

This is of course specially true about TV and movies. But to a lesser extent to all other forms of storytelling.

My point here is, why no one tells the kids that. There should be a course titled "how to translate the experiences you get from indirect means to real life".
