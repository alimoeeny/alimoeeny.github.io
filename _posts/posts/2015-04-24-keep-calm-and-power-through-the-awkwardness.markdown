I made this wallpaper while I was reading about the importance of being able to withstand awkwardness.
If I remember correctly, the claim was that people who can stay calm and keep their cool in awkward situations, when it is socially uncomfortable, have a higher rate of success in many fields.

So just "Keep Calm and Power Through The Awkwardness"
