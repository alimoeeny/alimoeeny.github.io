Our lives, I mean human lives, still depend on stupid things.

Of course for the majority of the population, life still depends on clean water and clean air and not being hit by a bus and not being bitten by an insect.

But that is not the most stupid part, because we have the solution to those problems, we just have not found a way to get the solution to everybody.

Even in the "best" situation, human lives still depend on other people keeping their eyes open, their minds ready, remembering a thousand things, being creative, and agile, being good decision makers, with a correct balance of risk taking and conservatism, being physically fit, and having extraordinary manual skills, while working endless hours of thankless jobs, in harsh psychological conditions. Of course these people are professional health care providers.
