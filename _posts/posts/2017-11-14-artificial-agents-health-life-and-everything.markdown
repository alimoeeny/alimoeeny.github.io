For many years, I have been thinking about what artificial intelligence and more generally machines can do to help us be healthier and generally live better lives.

&nbsp;

There are lots of things one can imagine. Many of them although prevalent in fiction are far from attainable in real life, like Robotic doctors who can cure anything and bring people back from the brinks of death no matter what.

&nbsp;

But I think at least for the time being more helpful and most successful agents will be the ones who can augments our abilities. Like in the self driving car domain, fancy adaptive cruise control is the most useful and successful way AI can be used, so far (yeah really).

&nbsp;

Similarly in health care, the most useful AI would be one who helps us have a better understanding of where we are and most importantly where we are headed health wise. For example if I know that with my current diet and physical activity, I am going to have completely ruined arteries by age 80 but if I add 10 minutes of running to my daily routine I'll push that back 10 years, I can then decide if that diet change which gives me a 15 more extra years of vascular health is more valuable to me or the daily run because of my current job situation that does not make daily running easy for me.

&nbsp;

The major obstacle here, in my opinion is the input. We still don't have practical ways to measure collect and use data about the state of our bodies and minds.
