We make decisions all the time, and the majority of these decisions are based on how we feel about the choices we face (or more accurately the choices we have in mind).
It usually works out OK. It has flaws, as evident by our limited self control, casing problems like obesity, violence, racism, sexism, patriotisms, and like.  
Definitely if we had other means of make "efficient" decisions we should have considered it, but we don't.

Maybe the most important problem here is not that we make bad decisions, but that we are too confident about the "obvious correctness" of these decisions that we make based on our feelings.
If you deliberate and research your treatment options when you have a serious disease, or research a car or home you want to buy you most likely will have less confidence in the correctness of the decision you will end up with compared to when you decide to vote for a candidate that "feels right" or go on a date or go to a trip that "sounds fun".

The other side of this is the somatic associations of gut feelings.
Like you might "feel" the same, when you have acid reflux, and when you are suspicious of a situation or a person. This means that if you have chocolate you will end up with more paranoid decisions.
