Brain is a computation device. So given the same input one expects to see the same output. <br />
But stress or even just being watched makes us act differently and perform differently.<br />
One way to think about it, is to say, Obviously these change the "inputs" or at least the global variables / environment in which we do computation. So no big deal, when we figure out who brain does task A, then we'll understand how stress affects our performance in task A.<br />
But it might also be the case that stress may change the hardware or generally speaking the computational resources available for a task. Like it may add noise? or increase sensitivity or generally change the setting of the system.<br />
Although we have a lot to learn about brain, the assumption of brain being a digital computer (or maybe even a turing machine) needs more thought. Or maybe my brain is under too much stress right now ...
