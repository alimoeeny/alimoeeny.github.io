When you learn something or experience something, it is usually easy and fast to recall the memory or use the skill. But as time goes by and you don't use that skill or recall that memory, it's as if it goes deeper and deeper into the "archives" of your brain and finding it and bringing it back takes more time and effort.
Why is that?
I don't have an answer, and to my knowledge we don't know the answer.
But it is fascinating to think about it.
Any thoughts?
