I think many businesses, hotels for example, are realizing, it costs less to hire nice people specially nice people who will engage customers online, rather than fixing things that costumers care about.

&npsp;

Like if I book a hotel room online and get the feeling that a nice person who cares about what I need is on the end of the line, it will be less likely that I complain or rank them low when the room has some problem or the heating doesn't work and such.

&nbsp;

Basically it costs less to hire a nice caring (the pretence of care works almost as well) person to answer email or engage on social media. Compared to keeping everything in best shape and spending money and time and energy into keeping everything running in top shape.
