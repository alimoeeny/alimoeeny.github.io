I remember enjoying my free time as a kid. Whenever I didn't have to go to school, which I hated going to at all the stages, I loved to read. I used to read sci-fi, novels, science books, explorer books, chemistry, physics, later I got into philosophy and religion. And computers, OH, computer books and magazines. The glorious days of computer magazines.

But these days, I really seem to have lost the ability to enjoy me free time.

What do you do?
