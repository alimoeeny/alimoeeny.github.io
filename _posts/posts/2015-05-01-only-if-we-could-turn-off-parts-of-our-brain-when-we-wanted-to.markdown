I [/posts/we-need-to-find-a-way-to-delete-things-from-our-brain-mind/](wrote) before about the need for a `delete` function in our brain operating system.
But even beyond that, we have uses for an `on`/`off` switch to parts of our brain.
Imagine you could chose any arbitrary chunk of your brain and turn it off, and later go back and turn it on (or to be safe, have it comeback online automatically after a certain period).
This would open incredible opportunities for self exploration (exploration of self, our motives, memories, assumptions, presumptions). We could look at things a new light. We could set aside some of our "knowledge" and reevaluate things. We could practice things in "hard mode".
It would be wonderful. And I would be willing to bet it will happen in my lifetime.
