You'd think in this age of social networks and information collection giants, it should be easy to find people. <br />
I mean finding people in the general sense. Finding people to collaborate with, to date, to run with, to have fun, to build a company, to work with, to just enjoy a movie with, to talk to, to get help from, to bounce ideas off, ...<br />
And it is not just hard for introverts like me. It is hard for everybody.<br />
Someone should do something about it.
