It will come a time, that we can control everything in our bodies.<br />
We can control reproduction, at will.<br />
We can control our skin color, at will.<br />
Change our hair texture, at will.<br />
Change the rate of our nail growth, at will.<br />
Change our mood, and attitude. Our memories.<br />
Change our skin tone, facial hair growth. and pattern. and color.<br />
Control hair distribution over our bodies.<br />

This will of course have many positive as well as negative consequences. And like anything other power that we gain through technology and science we need to collectively learn to control it and deal with it's consequences and side effects. And to help people who misuse it recover.
