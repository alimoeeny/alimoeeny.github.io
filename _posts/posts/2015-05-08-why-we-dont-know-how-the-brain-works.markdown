We still have no clue to how the brain works. Not that we don't know about how the brain functions. We know a lot, a lot about how different things in the brain function.
But still we don't know how the brain does it's most interesting jobs.
I believe it is not because we need more data (that definitely will help) but it is because we don't know what to look for. We don't have a theory of how the brain may work. When we have that then we can ask good questions and do experiments to check our theories.
