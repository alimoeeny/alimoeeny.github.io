Have you noticed that things in life come in clusters.  <br />
Like when you are driving in a highway, there are periods that there is nobody around, then a bunch of cars catch up to you, or you catch up with a bunch of cars are close to each other. Then there is no one for a while. <br />
Or you have periods that you are bored and looking for something to do, then all of a sudden, you are very busy both at work, and on your side projects, and with your family and there are movies you want to watch and books you want to read all at once. Then there is calm again. <br />
Or if you are a doctor, your patient is ok, everything is stable, and nothing is happening, all of a sudden, the patients, heart is failing, there are infections everywhere, kidneys are failing, mental state is disrupted, liver is screaming, bowels are not working, there is fluid collecting in the lungs and in the chest, then you get everything under control and the patient comes back to consciousness and goes home. <br />
In your car, ... <br />
In your love life, ...  <br />
In your financial life, ... <br />
