Every now and then you read something or hear someone complaining that time is cruel. It takes away our youth, our beauty, our super powers and eventually it wipes us off the collective consciousness.

But at least time is fair, or at least time does not discriminate. Time passes by more or less equally for everybody and everything.

As someone who was born and spent half of his life in one part of the world then moved to a totally different part of the world  I can tell you that space is cruel too, but also very unfairly so. 

It matters a lot where you are born and raised. It matters a lot where you live. 

Also moving through time is the same for everyone, but moving through space is not much.
