If you have ever experienced "pest" problems, be it ants, mice, rats, bugs, or deers! you may have run into this conundrum. <br />
You don't want use extreme measures to get rid of the pests, but you don't think it is safe for you and your loved ones to live with the pests, either.<br />
So ideally you don't want to use poisons, or kill or injure the pests, either because you think that is cruel or changes the balance of the environment and causes long term problems or you think these measures are dangerous for your own health and well being too.<br />
I can imagine a world in which we have full understanding and control of our environment and can control it in a way that we can live safely with some of the natural residents of our environment. Like if we live in a green area, naturally there are lots of bugs.<br />
Even one can imagine machines that monitor more dangerous creatures and keep us alert to their presence if needed or prevent them from hurting us, if needed.

I think I'd rather live with creatures if I knew they won't hurt me in a morbid way. This comes from someone who is too sensitive to mosquitoes and hates all reptiles ...
