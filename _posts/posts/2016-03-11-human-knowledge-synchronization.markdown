I absolutely understand the downsides. The Orwellian nightmare it potentially can lead to, but wouldn't it be great if we had a means to move all humanities understanding forward more or less at the same time.

Like, once we learned that vaccination is beneficial, we could keep it as a known in all humanities individual or collective consciousness. To prevent every other generation from trying it again.

Like, once we learned too much power in anybody's hand is dangerous, we all learned it all over the world, to prevent every nation from trying it every now and then.

Like, once we learned the limitations of science and the benefits of science we stick to it and don't over or under apply science.

Like, once we learned the boundary between religious and personal beliefs with social and political life we kept the separation all over the humanity and prevent repeating history.

Like, once we learned colonialism, slavery, sexism, oppression is not cool, we all stick to it.

I am being too naive I guess.
