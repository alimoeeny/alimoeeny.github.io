When I first heard that some people think studying philosophy is dangerous I thought "what? how can anyone think that, they must be a bunch of old timers that want no one to even think of questioning their authority". And I still think I was right for the most part.

But over the years I came to understand that there is some inherent danger to learning philosophy or generally thinking about fundamental questions of existence and life that nobody mentions is to the new students and thinkers.

I think the very important pitfall or danger that many new students of the fundamentals of life fall into is arrogance and confidence. When you are new to the subject specially if you are also young and have not lived a colorful life yet. It is easy to see yourself above others. And you in a sense are above many. You have thought about things that others have not. You know answers to very profound questions that others may have not even asked.

This can lead to isolation. As you think how can I even communicate with these unwashed masses of people that are so behind.

This is seriously dangerous.

This is in nature very similar to the confidence a religious person or a cult member can have. They also can see themselves above others, after all they know what is going on behind the scene.

The only remedy that I know of is "knowing that over the life time of humanity, people have asked and answered these questions and have always had differing opinions. It is great that you understand and care about them, but make sure you learn the opposing answers from different sides of the debate from unbiased sources".
