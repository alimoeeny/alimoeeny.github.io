There is this inherent conflict in any company or any human organization for that matter.
Unless you have a very very secure position you need to act "normal" to keep your position.
While you also want to care about the compnay/team and make it better.
These two motivations, to keep your position in the company, and to keep making the company a better place, are ideally aligned.
But in reality, you will be safer if you just played along with everybody else and avoided doing anything that can make you less desirable.
There are companies that have solved this at least to some extent, but I've never personally experiences a large company that is not suffering from this to some significant extent.
Looks like smaller companies are better at this.
