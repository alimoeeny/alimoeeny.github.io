To understand how evolution may work, we need to understand how long a few billion years is.
Also we need to understand how diverse our biosphere is.
Also we need to understand how random numbers work.
No wonder, I encounter people, even among the biologists who have an easier time accepting fairytales  than understanding how evolution can work.

I don't have any suggestion to help you understand how long a billion years is.
But I have a book to recommend, if you want to understand random numbers. It is one of the earlier books of [Nassim Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) called [Fooled By Randomness](http://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219).

In order to understand the biodiversity, just be more observant every time you go outside for a walk. After a few years of this, you will understand that even moving a few miles, changes the environment enough to cultivate differences in the kind of living beings that can thrive more effectively, and how varied that are.
