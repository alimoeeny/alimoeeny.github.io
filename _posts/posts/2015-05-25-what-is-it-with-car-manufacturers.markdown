You want to buy a car. It is 21st century. And you leave in the United States of America. <br />
Your life should be easy right? <br />
Of course your life is easier than the majority of the people who are living or ever lived on earth given the above.<br />
But, still you'd think when you want to buy a car, you should be able to go online, look at the options, get a feel of what is out there, decide what you want and buy it. Right?<br />
The problem is some people involved in this process over the course of it's short history, got into this position of making money off peoples lack of options and information.<br />
It feels as if you are playing an intricate game of chance.<br />
For example, I want to buy a new Subaru, wrx, hatchback, with keyless entry, and remote start, and LED lights. <br />
I don't need the damn navigation system, I don't ever use it, because I am spoiled by my phones turn by turn navigation. Neither I want to pay monthly feels for Satellite radio. Or even your supposedly fancy apps.  I have my phone. and I have a ton of choice. Even if I wanted to use Pandora to listen to music (which I don't because last.fm spoiled me) I use my phone, which is already has internet connection and ready to do so. <br />
Anyway, people, you are charging me tens of thousands of dollars for a car, be a bit more transparent and flexible. <br />
