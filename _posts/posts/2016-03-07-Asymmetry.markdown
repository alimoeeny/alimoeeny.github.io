Although I don't have kids I often imagine myself giving advice to my imaginary kids.
One of these lessons I keep telling my imaginary kids and myself is to keep in mind that life is full of asymmetries.
There are these fundamental asymmetries in life. It is essential to understand them to make sense of life.

For example, it is important not to judge people by their cloth (except if their job is to design or make cloths), bot to always keep close attention to what you yourself wear because most people cannot help but judge you based on your cloths.

There are tones of these asymmetries in life.
