I think I know what I am doing. I think I think and deliberate and use my brain and use my instincts to decide and do stuff or react to stuff.

&nbsp;

But as we understand it so far, it does not look like that is how "I" work.

&nbsp;

I make decisions, I react to stuff, I do stuff and then I tell I why I must have done it. I tell a story to myself about how I come up with that wise decision. Or how that irrational thing I did and am doing is the right thing to do.

&nbsp;

This is a fundamental problem. We need to do something about it.

&nbsp;

If it was the old days, I would say a new philosopher needs to come and change our view about ourselves.

&nbsp;

But it is very likely that we need a couple of people to found a start up and change our view about ourselves.
