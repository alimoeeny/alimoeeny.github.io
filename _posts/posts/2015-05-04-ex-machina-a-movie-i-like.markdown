We (Motahar and I) went to watch `Ex Machina` one more time and think about it and discuss it.
It definitely has artistic / technical flaws, some scenes could have been shorter while some other parts of the story need explanation for people unfamiliar with the whole idea, but the story or the idea is very good and very well done.
I specially like how they had put themselves into the `mind` of Eva and imagined how she would think and behave to approach the challenges of the world.
Since I don't want to spoil it, I am going to stop here.

But thinking about artificial intelligence reminded me of some old questions. Basically one can think of two pathways to making intelligence machines. One would be for us, to first understand intelligence and how it works and then find ways to build it into machines (which is basically most, or almost all) of AI research is all about. The second path would be to make things that `learn` to be intelligent by themselves, the same way we got our intelligence. I personally want to see this second path investigated more. And I believe this will give us both a shorter route to AI and a shorter route to understanding how intelligence works so if need be we can go through the first path too.
