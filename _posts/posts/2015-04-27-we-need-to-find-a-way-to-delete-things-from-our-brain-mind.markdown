Through out our lives, we accumulate experiences, learn new things, acquire new skills, form a myriad of memories. Although we think we don't keep all of these and over time we lose some or most of them (which is debatable). We don't have a way to control this process. We can of course "overwrite" an unwanted skill by training, or learn the correct thing after we decide something we had learned in the past was wrong, but we can not unlearn things or forget things as if we never learned them or knew them and go back to a fresh brain.

We need to find the `delete` command. Or maybe the reset button.

I think it can change everything.
