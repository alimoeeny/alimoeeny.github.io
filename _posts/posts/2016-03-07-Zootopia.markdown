Last night Motahar and I watched [Zootopia](http://letterboxd.com/film/zootopia/).
Hands down it was one of the best Disney movies in recent history. Although the story is not very strong, it is very well made.   
Specially the music stands out. Shakira, who also voice acts a pop start character also sings a beautiful song through out and at the end of the movie. [Try Everything](https://open.spotify.com/track/4THhG6r7WNnh5j8AtiUiSI)
