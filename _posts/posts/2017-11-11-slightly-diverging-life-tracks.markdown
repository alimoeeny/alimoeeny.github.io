Was a long time ago, feels like a different life or a dream [was actually like 9 years ago]. I was listening to this speech by Jim Rohn (yeah the old-school motivational speaker), and from all of it I remember this specific part left an impression on me.
He was talking about how making even a very tiny change in your habits or attitude toward life can over time add up. He gave this example of too almost parallel lines that have this very small deviation. And over time their distance gets larger and larger. The line here being life of you before and after change. Or life of you and your peers who did not do that tiny change.
His point was not to wait until you can make a large very significant looking change in your life, but take tiny steps even if they are very small and seemingly insignificant.
Over and over in my life I've seen how important this effect is.
