Now that I am old enough to have a significant sample size, I can see that my life and I assume many other's, oscillates up and down the normality ladder. <br />
I am not talking about mood swings or bipolarity or any other mood "conditions" here. By normality I mean looking average, looking normal, looking like most other people.<br />
Being normal here means, having a reasonably paying job, which is kinda boring and a bit tedious and silly, but if you tell people at a party that this is your job, people will node along and don't looks at you to make sure you are not joking. <br />
